1. Python: This script is written in Python. You need to have Python installed on your system.

2. CSV File: You should have the CSV file that you want to split. Specify the path to this file in the `input_file` variable.

3. Output Directory: You need to specify the directory where the split CSV files will be saved. Create this directory if it doesn't exist and set its path in the `output_directory` variable.

### Running the Script

To split the CSV file, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.

3. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

### Customization

You can customize the script by modifying the following variables at the beginning of the script:

- `input_file`: The path to the input CSV file you want to split.

- `output_directory`: The path to the directory where the split CSV files will be saved.

- `occurrences_per_file`: The number of rows to include in each split file.

## Function Documentation
